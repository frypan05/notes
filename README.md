- **Contributor Management**: Allow friends or colleagues to contribute files.
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visibility of new uploads for all users.
- **File Security**: Authentication and file access control.
- **User Roles**: Admin and Contributor roles with different access levels.
- **File Previews**: Ability to preview certain file types directly in the app.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket (for future feature addition)

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/collaborative-file-share.git
   cd collaborative-file-share
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development servers**:
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Start the frontend server (in the `client` directory):
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```plaintext
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_aws_s3_bucket_name
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

## Usage
1. **Upload Files**: Users can upload files directly through the web interface.
2. **File Preview**: Supported files are previewable upon upload.
3. **Manage Contributors**: Allow specific users to view or upload files.

## API Endpoints
Here’s a brief overview of the API routes used in this project:

- **POST** `/api/upload` - Upload a file (requires authentication).
- **GET** `/api/files` - Retrieve all files metadata (requires authentication).
- **GET** `/api/files/:id` - Retrieve a specific file by ID.
- **DELETE** `/api/files/:id` - Delete a file (requires admin privileges).

## File Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
collaborative-file-share/
├── client/                   # Frontend code (Next)
├── models/                   # Mongoose schemas (User.js, File.js)
├── routes/                   # API routes (auth, files)
